# NoXmit AI

NoXmit AI is a non-profit research project focused on privacy-preserving, local-only AI inference that does not transmit user inputs, designed for Tor-compatible static web deployment.

The project aims to evaluate whether such designs can provide meaningful privacy in real-world use, while also assessing their practical advantages and limitations.
